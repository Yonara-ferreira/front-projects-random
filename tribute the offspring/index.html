            <p class="main-text">
                In 1984, on the sunny sands of Huntington Beach, California,
                <strong>Dexter Holland</strong> and <strong>Greg Kriesel</strong> , two teenagers united by their love of punk rock, 
                planted the seed of what would become The Offspring. Inspired by bands like 
                Social Distortion and Black Flag, they joined Noodles Wasserman and Ron Welty to form 
                Manic Subsidal, starting a musical journey that would challenge norms and win millions 
                of fans around the world.

            <p>
             In 1986, the band adopted the name The Offspring,
             marking the beginning of a new era. With their energetic sound, irreverent lyrics, 
             and rebellious attitude, they released their self-titled debut album in 1989, selling over 8,000 
             copies independently. Their underground success propelled them to Epitaph Records, where they released 
             "Ignition" in 1991, solidifying their place in the Californian punk scene. But it was with the release of 
             "Smash" in 1994 that The Offspring exploded onto the global stage.
            "Smash" became a phenomenon, selling over 11 million copies in the US alone and spawning hits like 
            "Come Out and Play," "Self Esteem," and "Gotta Get Away." The band found themselves on international tours,
             playing to massive crowds and winning over new fans with every show.
